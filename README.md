A web application that allows users to draw on a canvas and generates an AI-powered description of the drawing. Using Flask as the backend, JavaScript for the canvas, and Meta's Vision model, this project turns sketches and doodles into meaningful descriptions. 

# Setup 

git clone https://github.com/AdeenIlyas/Doodle-AI.git

cd Doodle-AI

pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to run the application

Register for an api key through this link: https://docs.together.ai/docs/getting-started-with-llama-32-vision-models

Open the html file in live server.

Run the flask app using "python app.py".

Now you can start drawing inside the canvas. Once done, click on predict drawing to get the description of the image.
